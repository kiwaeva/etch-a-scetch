# 🎨 Etch A Sketch

**Etch A Sketch** is a simple web-based drawing application that allows users to "doodle" on a dynamic grid of square `<div>` elements. The app is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and it recreates the classic Etch A Sketch experience in the browser.

## 🛠️ Features

- Interactive grid dynamically generated with JavaScript
- Mouseover-based drawing functionality
- Adjustable grid size *(optional enhancement)*
- Clean and minimal UI for easy use

## 📌 Project Requirements

This project was built to meet the following core requirements:

- Use **JavaScript** to create a grid of square `<div>` elements — these should **not** be hardcoded in HTML.
- Allow users to draw on the grid by interacting with the squares.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/etch-a-sketch.git
